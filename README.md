# Shiny-App-Toxicology

1. This web app uses the database file called Database_Toxicology_Own.db. All the needed data to run the app is already in this database.

2. This app has been created in R Studio with version R 4.4.3 and you will need either this R version or a more recent one.

3. You will need to install the ToxPi R package. The app does this automatically, but in case it does not work for you please install it from here (3 options): https://github.com/ToxPi/toxpiR.
